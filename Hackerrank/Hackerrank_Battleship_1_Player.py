    Purpose: Determine next coordinate on the battleship board

    Params:
    grid: the grid size N*N
          h == hit (ship is hit but not yet destroyed)
          d == destroyed (ship is destroyed)
          m == miss
          - == cell has not been attacked by player

    Strategy:
    PRIORITIES

    ALGORITHM
    - if no hits on board, choose random guess in a criss-cross fashion, ie skip 1 cell.
    - if hit: check surrounding cells
        - if no hits, choose any open cell as the guess
        - if hit(s), choose the cell opposite the hit if possible
          else if not open cell, move to the next hit cell and repeat
